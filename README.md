Disaster Response Classification Project

ETL Pipeline Preparation Objective: This project aims to create an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing disaster response data. The following steps outline how to build the pipeline and prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

Steps:

1. Import Libraries and Load Datasets
Import the necessary Python libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
numpy for numerical operations.
sqlalchemy for saving data to an SQLite database.
Load the messages.csv file into a pandas DataFrame and inspect the first few rows using df.head().
Load the categories.csv file into another pandas DataFrame and inspect the first few rows.
2. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Merge the messages and categories datasets using the id column as the key.
Clean the categories column:
Split the values in categories into individual category columns using the separator ;.
Extract the category names from the first row and rename the new columns.
Convert the values in each category column to binary (0 or 1) by extracting the last character of each string and converting it to an integer.
Drop the original categories column from the merged dataset and add the newly created category columns.
Remove duplicate rows from the dataset using drop_duplicates().
Handle missing values:
Fill missing categorical values with the most frequent value in each column.
Fill missing numerical values with the median value of the respective columns.
3. Save Clean Dataset into SQLite Database
Create a connection to an SQLite database using SQLAlchemy (e.g., sqlite:///DisasterResponse.db).
Save the cleaned DataFrame into the database as a table named DisasterMessages using the to_sql() method.
4. Create process_data.py Script
Write a Python script named process_data.py to automate the above steps:
Load Data:
Read data from messages.csv and categories.csv.
Clean Data:
Merge, clean, and transform the datasets as described above.
Save Data:
Save the cleaned DataFrame into an SQLite database named DisasterResponse.db under the DisasterMessages table.
5. Final Output
The output will be a cleaned dataset stored in an SQLite database (DisasterResponse.db), which includes the DisasterMessages table. This data will be ready for further analysis or model training.

**# ML**
ML Pipeline Preparation

Objective:
This project aims to build and fine-tune a Machine Learning (ML) pipeline for classifying disaster response messages into multiple categories. The steps below outline how to process the data, build the ML pipeline, improve the model, and export the trained model.

The required libraries:
mport pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import nltk
import pickle
import re
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline, FeatureUnion
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
Download necessary NLTK data
nltk.download(['punkt', 'wordnet', 'averaged_perceptron_tagger'])
from sklearn.datasets import make_multilabel_classification

Steps:
1. Import Libraries and Load Data from Database
Import the necessary Python libraries, including those for machine learning and data manipulation.
Load the cleaned dataset from the SQLite database using read_sql_table from pandas.
Define the feature variable X (the message column) and the target variable y (36 categories in the dataset).
2. Build the Machine Learning Pipeline
Build a machine learning pipeline to process the data and classify the messages.
The pipeline should:
Take the message column as input.
Output classification results for the 36 categories.
Consider using MultiOutputClassifier for predicting multiple target variables (categories) simultaneously.
3. Train and Evaluate the Model
Train the model using the pipeline on the dataset.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
4. Improve Your Model
Use grid search or other hyperparameter tuning methods to find better parameters for your model.
After tuning, evaluate the model again and display the updated accuracy, precision, and recall.
Fine-tune your models to improve their performance, especially for your portfolio. Ensure high scores in these metrics for better model quality.
5. Further Model Improvement Ideas
Try experimenting with different machine learning algorithms to see if they yield better results.
Add other features to your model, such as text features beyond TF-IDF, or metadata like message length, etc.
Explore other data transformation techniques that might improve performance.
6. Export the Trained Model
Once the model is fine-tuned, export the trained model using the pickle library to save it for future use in production or deployment.
7. Create train_classifier.py Script
Create a Python script (train_classifier.py) that automates the above steps:
Load the data from the SQLite database.
Clean and preprocess the data.
Build, train, and evaluate the machine learning model.
Export the trained model as a pickle file.
Final Output:
The trained machine learning model will be saved as a pickle file, ready for deployment or further analysis.
The process ensures the model is tuned for optimal performance and can classify disaster messages into the appropriate categories based on the input.

Description**
This project is part of the Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity, in collaboration with Figure Eight. The dataset includes pre-labeled tweets and messages from real-life disaster events. The goal of this project is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that can categorize messages in real-time.
The project is divided into the following key sections:
1. Data Processing: An ETL pipeline to extract data, clean it, and save it in a SQLite database.
2. Machine Learning Pipeline: Building and training a machine learning model to classify text messages into various categories.
3. Web Application: Running a web app to display real-time classification results.
